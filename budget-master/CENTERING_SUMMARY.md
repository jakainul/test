# Budget Master - Total Salaries UI Centering Summary

## Task Completed ✅

Successfully centered the "Total Salaries" display in the Budget Master UI.

- **`.total-card`** - Increased padding and added min-width for better presence
- **`.total-amount`** - Increased font size from 1.5rem to 2rem
- **`.total-label`** - Increased font size and added font-weight for better legibility

## Documentation Created

1. **`UI_CENTERING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`** - Detailed technical documentation of all changes
2. **`UI_PREVIEW.html`** - Interactive HTML preview showing before/after comparison
3. **`CENTERING_SUMMARY.md`** - This file, providing a quick overview
