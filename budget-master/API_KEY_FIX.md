# API Key Configuration Fix

## Problem
The Budget Master project couldn't find stock tickers because the `.env` file was missing from the backend directory in the workspace.

## Root Cause
- The `.env` file existed on your local machine but was not present in the workspace
- The `.env` file is typically in `.gitignore` to prevent API keys from being committed to version control
- Without the `.env` file, the `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY` environment variable was undefined

## Solution Implemented
1. **Created `.env` file** in `/workspace/budget-master/backend/.env` with:
   ```
   ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=6KAF0613N0D1L7AX
   PORT=5001
   ```

2. **Installed dependencies** using `npm install` in the backend directory

3. **Verified API key configuration**:
   - API key is correctly loaded by Node.js
   - API key format is valid (16 characters, alphanumeric)
   - API key works with Alpha Vantage API

4. **Started backend server** and tested stock ticker functionality

## Verification Tests Passed ✓
- ✅ Environment variables loaded correctly
- ✅ API key format validated (16 characters)
- ✅ Alpha Vantage API responds successfully
- ✅ Backend server health check passes
- ✅ Stock ticker validation works (AAPL added to watchlist)
- ✅ Real-time stock quote retrieval works

## Code Configuration (Already Correct)
The code was already properly configured to use the API key:

### `/workspace/budget-master/backend/services/alphaVantageService.js`
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
const API_KEY = process.env.ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY;
```

### `/workspace/budget-master/backend/server.js`
```javascript
require('dotenv').config();
// API key is passed to stockService which reads it from environment
```

## Next Steps
1. The backend server is now running and can validate stock tickers
2. You can test the stock watchlist feature in the frontend
3. Remember to copy the `.env` file to any new environments where you deploy

## Important Notes
- The `.env` file contains sensitive API keys and should never be committed to git
- Keep your `.env` file in your local machine's backend directory
- When deploying to production, set environment variables through your hosting platform
- Alpha Vantage free tier has a rate limit of 5 API calls per minute

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Test adding a ticker to watchlist
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/stocks/watchlist \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"ticker":"AAPL"}'

# Test getting stock quote
curl http://localhost:5001/api/stocks/quote/AAPL

# Test getting complete stock data
curl http://localhost:5001/api/stocks/data/AAPL
```
